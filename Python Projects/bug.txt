#### Environment details (Put `x` in the checkbox along with the information)

- [x] Operating System: Manjaro Linux
- [x] Desktop Environment: Xfce
- [x] Terminal Emulator: Alarcitty
- [x] Shell: zsh
- [ ] Custom desktop opener (if applicable):
- [ ] Program options used:
- [ ] Configuration options set:
- [ ] Plugins are installed
- [ ] Issue exists on `nnn` master

#### Exact steps to reproduce the issue
I'm having a directory with name : `VS Code` i.e. the directory name has space in it.
Suppose I want to copy complete path of a file that is inside this `VS Code` directory.

I used nnn -x to copy the path to clipboard it returned : 

```
/home/himanshu/Desktop/VS Code/myfile.py
```
Now if tried to open this file using neovim :
```
nvim /home/himanshu/Desktop/VS Code/myfile.py
```
then neovim will consider them as two different files : 
/home/himanshu/Desktop/VS
Code/myfile.py

### The right address that should be returned for usage is:
```
/home/himanshu/Desktop/VS\ Code/myfile.py
```

This address returning with space is a problem with other commands as well:

**For Ex:**
If i tried to list paths using `ls -l $(nnn -p -)` and i selected :
VS Code - a directory
config.toml - a file
config.... - another file

**Note:** _**This is only a problem when using these paths is shell.  Because i've used these paths in python and they work well**_
